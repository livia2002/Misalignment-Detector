# Deep Learning-Based Misalignment Detection for Cryo-EM Images
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This repository contains the code for detecting misalignments in cryo-EM images using deep learning. The project preprocesses cryo-EM data, generates correlation maps, and trains a ResNet model to classify image alignment quality.
